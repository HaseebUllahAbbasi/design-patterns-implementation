## Requirements

For simplicity reasons, the examples are console apps. In order to launch them, you have to install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer and then install [TypeScript compiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) and [TypeScript Node extension](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) like this:

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```
